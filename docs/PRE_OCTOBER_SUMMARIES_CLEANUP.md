## 📊 **Rationale**

These files were archived because:
1. **Redundant Information** - Content consolidated into main status documents
2. **Outdated Status** - Progress reports from specific dates are no longer current
3. **Better Organization** - Current status now in consolidated documents:
   - `docs/refactoring/REFACTORING_STATUS.md` - Current refactoring status
   - `docs/PRIORITIZED_WORK.md` - Current prioritized work
   - `docs/project-history/CLEANUP_STATUS.md` - Current cleanup status
