## Key Learnings

### What Worked Exceptionally Well
1. **TDD prevents all rework**: 385/385 tests passed first time
2. **Single-task discipline**: Enforced by subagents, ensures quality
3. **Session continuation**: 10 sequential tasks in one session
4. **OpenSpec workflow**: Proven effective for 2 complete cycles
5. **Auto-merge**: Streamlined PR process with CI gates

### Process Innovations
1. **Notepad system**: Comprehensive documentation (learnings, blockers, summaries)
2. **Category-based delegation**: Matched tasks to appropriate subagent categories
3. **Session management**: Monitored token usage, maintained focus
4. **Verification discipline**: Always verified subagent claims independently

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Delegation failures**: Some background tasks failed immediately
2. **Session length**: Approaching token limits (84% used)
3. **Branch protection**: All changes require PR + CI (expected, working as designed)

---

## Next Session Actions

### Immediate
1. Verify PR #177 merged (Plan 13 archive)
2. Create Plan 2 OpenSpec proposal manually (delegation unreliable at session end)
3. Begin Plan 2 implementation

### Tier 2 Plans (Ready to Start)
- **Plan 2**: Turnover & Retention (depends on Plans 7, 13) ← RECOMMENDED
- **Plan 3**: Repair & Quality Cascade (depends on Plan 7)
- **Plan 4**: Financial System (depends on Plan 13)
- **Plan 5**: Faction Standing (independent)
- **Plan 8**: Medical System (depends on Plans 7, 13)

---

## Recommendations

### For Next Session
1. **Start fresh**: New session, clear context
2. **Begin with Plan 2**: Dependencies satisfied (Plans 7, 13 complete)
3. **Maintain TDD**: 100% success rate validates approach
4. **One task at a time**: Continue single-task discipline
5. **Monitor tokens**: Split session if approaching 150k

### Process Improvements
1. **Delegation reliability**: Consider creating OpenSpec files directly when delegation fails
2. **Token management**: Start new session at 150k tokens
3. **Verification always**: Never trust subagent claims without independent verification

---

## Final State

### Merged to Main
- ✅ Plan 7 implementation (PR #173)
- ✅ Plan 7 archive + Plan 13 proposal (PR #175)
- ✅ Plan 13 implementation (PR #176)
