## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Strict all-family numerical parity

Every applicable numerical construction/BV result and available component term SHALL differ strictly less than 1% from its matched loaded-entity reference: `abs(actual - reference) / abs(reference) < 0.01`. Zero references SHALL require exact zero. Missing or nonfinite results SHALL fail. Discrete design facts SHALL match exactly. Existing mech BV regression gates SHALL remain enforced, but their broader aggregate thresholds SHALL NOT establish this stricter readiness.

#### Scenario: Reject the tolerance boundary

- **GIVEN** reference BV 1000
- **WHEN** local BV is 1010 or 990
- **THEN** the comparison SHALL fail without pre-rounding the relative error
- **WHEN** local BV is 1009 or 991
- **THEN** that numerical comparison SHALL pass

#### Scenario: Reject missing and compensating errors

- **GIVEN** matching total weight but a failing engine or controls term
- **WHEN** numerical readiness is evaluated
- **THEN** the unit SHALL fail component parity
- **AND** zero, missing and nonfinite reference/result cases SHALL be handled explicitly

#### Scenario: Separate unsupported metrics from missing implementation

- **GIVEN** a metric unsupported by the upstream entity's rules
- **WHEN** a report marks that metric inapplicable
- **THEN** it SHALL include the upstream-supported reason
- **AND** local unimplemented calculations SHALL remain failures rather than inapplicable results
