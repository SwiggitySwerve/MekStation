## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Water Cooling Bonus

Heat dissipation SHALL include water cooling bonuses when a unit is standing in water.

#### Scenario: Standing in water depth 1

- **WHEN** a unit is standing in water at depth 1 during the heat phase
- **THEN** heat dissipation SHALL be increased by 2 points

#### Scenario: Standing in water depth 2+

- **WHEN** a unit is standing in water at depth 2 or greater during the heat phase
- **THEN** heat dissipation SHALL be increased by 4 points

### Requirement: Engine Hit Heat

Each engine critical hit SHALL generate +5 additional heat per turn.

#### Scenario: One engine hit adds 5 heat

- **WHEN** a unit has 1 engine critical hit
- **THEN** the unit SHALL generate an additional 5 heat per turn
- **AND** this heat SHALL be added during the heat generation phase

#### Scenario: Two engine hits add 10 heat

- **WHEN** a unit has 2 engine critical hits
- **THEN** the unit SHALL generate an additional 10 heat per turn (cumulative)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Heat Generation

The system SHALL track heat generated by weapons and movement.

#### Scenario: Weapon heat from actual data

- **WHEN** weapons are fired
- **THEN** heat generated SHALL equal the sum of actual weapon heat values from `IWeaponData`
- **AND** heat values SHALL be looked up from the weapon's data definition
- **AND** hardcoded heat values (e.g., `weapons.length * 10`) SHALL NOT be used

#### Scenario: Movement heat corrected

- **WHEN** a mech walks
- **THEN** walking SHALL generate 1 heat
- **WHEN** a mech runs
- **THEN** running SHALL generate 2 heat
- **WHEN** a mech jumps
- **THEN** jumping SHALL generate heat equal to `max(3, jumpMPUsed)`
- **AND** the hardcoded `Jump ? 1 : 0` SHALL NOT be used

#### Scenario: Alpha strike heat

- **WHEN** all weapons are fired simultaneously
- **THEN** alpha strike heat SHALL equal the sum of actual heat values from all weapons

### Requirement: Heat Dissipation

The system SHALL calculate heat dissipation from heat sinks.

#### Scenario: Heat sink dissipation from actual count

- **WHEN** calculating heat dissipation
- **THEN** single heat sinks SHALL dissipate 1 heat each
- **AND** double heat sinks SHALL dissipate 2 heat each
- **AND** total dissipation SHALL use the unit's actual heat sink count
- **AND** the hardcoded `baseHeatSinks = 10` SHALL NOT be used
- **AND** destroyed heat sinks SHALL be subtracted from the count

#### Scenario: Net heat calculation

- **WHEN** calculating net heat
- **THEN** net heat SHALL equal heat generated minus heat dissipated (including water cooling and minus destroyed heat sinks)
