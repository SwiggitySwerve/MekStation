# Meta-Documentation Archive

**Date:** January 2025

This directory contains documentation about documentation organization and cleanup efforts. These are meta-documents that describe the process of organizing documentation rather than actual project documentation.

## Archived Files

- `DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of documentation consolidation
- `DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of documentation organization
- `PRE_OCTOBER_SUMMARIES_CLEANUP.md` - Summary of pre-October cleanup
- `DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Cleanup recommendations (used to identify files to clean)

## Note

These files document the documentation organization process. They're kept for reference but are not part of the active documentation structure.
