# Oxlint Configuration Notes

## Deferred Type-Aware Rules

The following type-aware rules from `eslint.config.mjs` are **not enabled** in `.oxlintrc.json` due to tsconfig `baseUrl` incompatibility with oxlint's type-aware linting:

- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-call`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return`
- `@typescript-eslint/explicit-module-boundary-types`

These rules will be re-evaluated once oxlint's type-aware linting supports `baseUrl` or the project's tsconfig is refactored.

## Unsupported Rules

### `no-restricted-syntax`

**Status:** Cannot be enforced via oxlint

**Reason:** This is an ESLint core rule that uses AST selectors (`TSAsExpression > TSAsExpression`). Oxlint does not natively support this rule, and the JS Plugins system only supports ESLint _plugins_, not ESLint _core rules_.

**Impact:** The double-as assertion pattern (`as unknown as`) will not be caught by oxlint.

**Options:**

1. Accept losing this rule during the migration
2. Maintain a minimal hybrid ESLint config for this one rule
3. Wait for oxlint to add native support for `no-restricted-syntax`

**Current decision:** Documented as unsupported. Orchestrator will decide on hybrid approach.

## E2E Test Overrides

E2E tests (`e2e/**/*.ts`) have relaxed rules to allow:

- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: warn` (instead of error)

Note: The ESLint config also disables type-aware rules for E2E tests, but these are already not enabled in the oxlint config.
